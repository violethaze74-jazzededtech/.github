# Installing gh on Linux and BSD

Packages downloaded from https://cli.github.com or from https://github.com/cli/cli/releases
are considered official binaries. We focus on popular Linux distros and
the following CPU architectures: `i386`, `amd64`, `arm64`, `armhf`.

Other sources for installation are community-maintained and thus might lag behind
our release schedule.

## Official sources

### Debian, Ubuntu Linux, Raspberry Pi OS (apt)

Install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
```

**Note**: If you get the error _"gpg: failed to start the dirmngr '/usr/bin/dirmngr': No such file or directory"_, try installing the `dirmngr` package: `sudo apt install dirmngr`.

Upgrade:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
```

sudo dnf update gh
```

### openSUSE/SUSE Linux (zypper)

```bash
sudo zypper addrepo https://cli.github.com/packages/rpm/gh-cli.repo
sudo zypper ref
sudo zypper install gh
```

Upgrade:

```bash
sudo zypper ref
sudo zypper update gh
```

## Manual installation

* [Download release binaries][releases page] that match your platform; or
* [Build from source](./source.md).

## Unofficial, community-supported methods

The GitHub CLI team does not maintain the following packages or repositories and thus we are unable to provide support for those installation methods.

### Snap (do not use)

There are [so many issues with Snap](https://github.com/casperdcl/cli/issues/7) as a runtime mechanism for apps like GitHub CLI that our team suggests _never installing gh as a snap_.

### Arch Linux

Arch Linux users can install from the [community repo][arch linux repo]:

```bash
sudo pacman -S github-cli
```

Alternatively, use the [unofficial AUR package][arch linux aur] to build GitHub CLI from source.

### Android

Android 7+ users can install via [Termux](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Main_Page):

```bash
pkg install gh
```

### FreeBSD

FreeBSD users can install from the [ports collection](https://www.freshports.org/devel/gh/):

```bash
cd /usr/ports/devel/gh/ && make install clean
```

Or via [pkg(8)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?pkg(8)):

```bash
pkg install gh
```

### OpenBSD

In -current, or in releases starting from 7.0, OpenBSD users can install from packages:

```
pkg_add github-cli
```

### Funtoo

Funtoo Linux has an autogenerated github-cli package, located in [dev-kit](https://github.com/funtoo/dev-kit/tree/1.4-release/dev-util/github-cli), which can be installed in the following way:

``` bash
emerge -av github-cli
```

Upgrading can be done by syncing the repos and then requesting an upgrade:

``` bash
ego sync
emerge -u github-cli
```

### Gentoo

Gentoo Linux users can install from the [main portage tree](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-util/github-cli):

``` bash
emerge -av github-cli
```

Upgrading can be done by updating the portage tree and then requesting an upgrade:

``` bash
emerge --sync
emerge -u github-cli
