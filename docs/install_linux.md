# Installing gh on Linux

Packages downloaded from https://cli.github.com or from https://github.com/cli/cli/releases
are considered official binaries. We focus on popular Linux distros and
the following CPU architectures: `i386`, `amd64`, `arm64`.

Other sources for installation are community-maintained and thus might lag behind
our release schedule.

If none of our official binaries, packages, repositories, nor community sources work for you, we recommend using our `Makefile` to build `gh` from source. It's quick and easy.

## Official sources

### Debian, Ubuntu Linux (apt)

Install:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key C99B11DEB97541F0
sudo apt-add-repository https://cli.github.com/packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
```

**Note**: If you are behind a firewall, the connection to `keyserver.ubuntu.com` might fail. In that case, try running `sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-key C99B11DEB97541F0`.

**Note**: If you get _"gpg: failed to start the dirmngr '/usr/bin/dirmngr': No such file or directory"_ error, try installing the `dirmngr` package. Run `sudo apt-get install dirmngr` and repeat the steps above.  

**Note**: most systems will have `apt-add-repository` already. If you get a _command not found_
error, try running `sudo apt install software-properties-common` and trying these steps again.


Upgrade:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
```

### Fedora, CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (dnf)

Install:

```bash
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://cli.github.com/packages/rpm/gh-cli.repo
sudo dnf install gh
```

Upgrade:

```bash
sudo dnf update gh
```

### openSUSE/SUSE Linux (zypper)

Install:

```bash
sudo zypper addrepo https://cli.github.com/packages/rpm/gh-cli.repo
sudo zypper ref
sudo zypper install gh
```

Upgrade:

```bash
sudo zypper ref
sudo zypper update gh
```

## Unofficial, Community-supported methods

The core GitHub CLI team does not maintain the following packages or repositories. They are unofficial and we are unable to provide support or guarantees for them. They are linked here as a convenience and their presence does not imply continued oversight from the CLI core team. Users who choose to use them do so at their own risk.

### Arch Linux

Arch Linux users can install from the [community repo][arch linux repo]:

```bash
sudo pacman -S github-cli
```

### Android

Android users can install via Termux:

```bash
pkg install gh
```

### Kiss Linux

Kiss Linux users can install from the [community repos](https://github.com/kisslinux/community):

```bash
kiss b github-cli && kiss i github-cli
```

### Nix/NixOS

Nix/NixOS users can install from [nixpkgs](https://search.nixos.org/packages?show=gitAndTools.gh&query=gh&from=0&size=30&sort=relevance&channel=20.03#disabled):

```bash
nix-env -iA nixos.gitAndTools.gh
```

### Snaps

Many Linux distro users can install using Snapd from the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/gh) or the associated [repo](https://github.com/casperdcl/cli/tree/snap)

```bash
sudo snap install --edge gh && snap connect gh:ssh-keys
```
> Snaps are auto-updated every 6 hours. `Snapd` is required and is available on a wide range of Linux distros.
> Find out which distros have Snapd pre-installed and how to install it in the [Snapcraft Installation Docs](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd)
>
> **Note:** `snap connect gh:ssh-keys` is needed for all authentication and SSH needs.
