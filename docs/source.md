# Installation from source

0. Verify that you have Go 1.13+ installed

   ```sh
   $ go version
   ```

   If `go` is not installed, follow instructions on [the Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).

1. Clone this repository

   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/cli/cli.git gh-cli
   $ cd gh-cli
   ```

2. Build and install

   #### Unix-like systems
   ```sh
   # installs to '/usr/local' by default; sudo may be required
   $ make install
   
   # or, install to a different location
   $ make install prefix=/path/to/gh
   ```

   #### Windows 
   ```pwsh
   # build the `bin\gh.exe` binary
   > go run script\build.go
   ```
   There is no install step available on Windows.

3. Run `gh version` to check if it worked.

   #### Windows
   Run `bin\gh version` to check if it worked.

## Cross-compiling binaries for different platforms

You can use any platform with Go installed to build a binary that is intended for another platform
or CPU architecture. This is achieved by setting environment variables such as GOOS and GOARCH.

For example, to compile the `gh` binary for the 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS:
```sh
# on a Unix-like system:
$ GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=7 CGO_ENABLED=0 make clean bin/gh
```
```pwsh
# on Windows, pass environment variables as arguments to the build script:
> go run script\build.go clean bin\gh GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=7 CGO_ENABLED=0
```

Run `go tool dist list` to list all supported values of GOOS/GOARCH.

Tip: to reduce the size of the resulting binary, you can use `GO_LDFLAGS="-s -w"`. This omits
symbol tables used for debugging. See the list of [supported linker flags](https://golang.org/cmd/link/).
