## Hi there 👋

<!Lisa Dudley



🙋‍♀️ I am a one person Organization named JazzEd EdTech
🌈 I am open to all suggestions and options provided by the community. I get overwhelmed and confused by all the information out there.
👩‍💻 As a result of this confusion, I am still trying to find the right home for my work.I have few different websites, but none feel right yet.
   I don't eat breakfast, too much to do! Like learning about the power of Markdown :)
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
